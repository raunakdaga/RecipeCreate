This project utilizes Google Cloud Vision in order to classify images of food into labels. We then use these labels in partnership with RecipeLand.com to search for recipes, and return possible recipes.

We would like to acknowledge @alexgisby for creating imguralbum.py, allowing us to download your imgur albums.
